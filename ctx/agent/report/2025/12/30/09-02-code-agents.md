# Iteration Report

## Summary of Changes

- Added AGENTS context files for `ctx/docs/code/` and `ctx/docs/code/conventions/` to formalize local documentation boundaries and level maps.

## Work Details

- Created `ctx/docs/code/AGENTS.md` with purpose, level map, and boundary declarations for engineering norms.
- Created `ctx/docs/code/conventions/AGENTS.md` with purpose, level map, and boundary declarations for naming conventions.

## Results

- Documentation chain now includes local AGENTS definitions for `ctx/docs/code/` and `ctx/docs/code/conventions/`.
- New context files are ready for use by agents and align with the ADSM level map requirements.
