# Iteration Report

## Goal

Create `ctx/docs/product/AGENTS.md` for the new cognitive context level, applying hierarchical `AGENTS.md` requirements and validating semantic consistency inside `ctx/docs/product/`.

## Performed Actions

- Read and applied hierarchical instructions from `AGENTS.md`, `ctx/AGENTS.md`, and `ctx/docs/AGENTS.md` for the target directory scope.
- Inspected level documents in `ctx/docs/product/`: `overview.md`, `principles.md`, and `scope.md`.
- Performed intra-level semantic consistency check for product terms and boundaries: product identity, EDD declaration model, parser-profile compatibility boundary, deterministic runtime linking intent, immutability guarantees, and responsibility limits.
- Created `ctx/docs/product/AGENTS.md` with purpose, level boundaries, consistency rule, and complete level map aligned with the directory structure.

## Produced Artifacts

- Created: `ctx/docs/product/AGENTS.md`
- Created: `ctx/agent/report/2026/02/16/05-27-product-agents.md`

## Semantic Check Result

No internal semantic contradictions were found within `ctx/docs/product/` for the current level. The documents consistently define product purpose, scope boundary, and principle-level constraints.
