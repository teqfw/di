# Remove IdentifierName Reference from EDD Lexical Definition

## Goal

Remove the remaining mention of `IdentifierName` from `ctx/docs/architecture/edd-model.md` to avoid any residual terminology ambiguity.

## Actions

1. Updated the explanatory sentence under `AsciiEddIdentifier` definition.
2. Replaced ECMAScript-term-based phrasing with a direct declarative description of the class.
3. Kept lexical rule semantics unchanged.

## Artifacts

Updated file:

- `ctx/docs/architecture/edd-model.md`

Created report:

- `ctx/agent/report/2026/02/16/19-06-remove-identifiername-reference.md`
