# Product Documentation (`./ctx/docs/product/`)

Path: `./ctx/docs/product/AGENTS.md`

## Purpose

The `ctx/docs/product/` directory defines the product-level meaning of `@teqfw/di`, including its problem domain, value, architectural positioning, principles, and responsibility boundaries.

## Level Boundaries

This level describes what the product is, what responsibility it accepts, and what responsibility it excludes. It does not define immutable pipeline structure in full architectural detail, organizational interaction procedures, or implementation-level code conventions.

## Consistency Rule

Documents of this level must remain semantically aligned in product identity, declared scope, deterministic runtime linking intent, EDD-based declaration model, parser-profile compatibility boundary, and immutability-oriented guarantees. Product statements may differ in granularity but must not introduce conflicting responsibility boundaries or conflicting product positioning.

## Level Map

- `AGENTS.md` — this document, defining purpose, boundaries, and consistency rules of the product level.
- `overview.md` — product overview describing purpose, domain problem, architectural position, and value.
- `principles.md` — declarative product principles that constrain product behavior and evolution.
- `scope.md` — product scope and explicit responsibility boundaries, including out-of-scope concerns.

## Summary

`ctx/docs/product/AGENTS.md` defines the governed space of the product documentation level and provides a navigational anchor for its documents while preserving internal semantic consistency.
