# Code Conventions (`./ctx/docs/code/conventions/`)

Path: `./ctx/docs/code/conventions/AGENTS.md`
Version: `20260219`

## Purpose

The `ctx/docs/code/conventions/` directory contains implementation-level conventions that define normative engineering patterns and code organization rules used across the project.

## Level Boundaries

This level specifies code and implementation conventions only. It does not define product meaning, system constraints, architectural form, execution dynamics, or agent operating procedures.

## Level Map

- `teqfw/` — TEQFW-specific conventions and normative implementation patterns.
- `AGENTS.md` — this document, defining the purpose, boundaries, and navigational map of the `conventions/` level.

## Summary

`ctx/docs/code/conventions/` provides structured access to engineering conventions and serves as the entry point for project- and framework-specific code convention documents.
