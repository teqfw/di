# Code Conventions Context

Path: `ctx/docs/code/conventions/AGENTS.md`

## Purpose

The `conventions/` level fixes local naming and structural conventions used in the codebase. It declares precise rules for namespace and identifier usage that complement the broader engineering norms defined at the `code/` level.

## Level Map

- `AGENTS.md` — this document, defining the boundaries of the conventions level.
- `namespace.md` — namespace and naming conventions for code artifacts.

## Boundaries

This level:

- declares naming and namespace conventions for the codebase.

This level does not:

- define API boundaries or runtime contracts;
- introduce architectural or product-level constraints;
- specify agent behavior or reporting procedures.
