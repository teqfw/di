# @teqfw/di releases

## 0.35.0 – Support for Node.js Module Mocking in Test Mode

- DI container (test mode): extended support to register not only singleton instances but also mock implementations of
  native Node.js modules, enabling more flexible and robust unit testing.
- Added missing property `TeqFw_Di_DepId.isNodeModule` to properly identify Node.js modules in the dependency resolution
  process.
- Improved documentation (`README.md` and `PHILOSOPHY.md`) to clarify the design philosophy of TeqFW and explain the
  immutability and test mode features in greater detail.

## 0.34.0 – Strict Mode and Test Support

- Removed outdated interface `TeqFw_Di_Api_Container` and associated documentation.
- Unified the `get()` and `compose()` methods for dependency retrieval.
- Introduced strict mode by default: manual registration of dependencies is now **disabled** unless explicitly allowed.
- Added `enableTestMode()` method to the container, enabling safe, test-specific manual registration of singleton
  dependencies.
- Improved error messages and safeguards against accidental overwrites in `register()`.
- Updated internal naming and documentation for better clarity and alignment with the platform's principles.
- Cleaned up ESLint and JSDoc inconsistencies in internal files.

## 0.33.0 – Cleanup and Enhancements

- Removed deprecated documentation.
- Updated ESLint rules for consistency with current platform practices.
- Introduced `#` as a separator (in addition to `.`) between namespace and export names.

## 0.32.0 - added support for the `node:` prefix

- **Added ability** to manually register objects in the container (`register`).
- **Optimized dependency parsing**, added support for the `node:` prefix.
- **Updated singleton handling**, fixed issues with `Defs.LS`.
- **Added protection against object modification**, freezing objects when possible (`Object.freeze`).
- **Updated dependencies** (Mocha, Rollup, Rollup plugins).

## 0.31.0

* Added optional `stack` parameter to the `get` method for improved dependency tracking and debugging.
* Fixed browser example in the README by updating the usage of `window.TeqFw_Di_Container` for compatibility.

## 0.30.2

* Enhanced the README with updates from ChatGPT.
* Unified JSDoc annotations.

## 0.30.1

* Improve the README.

## 0.30.0

* New format of the depId for default parser (`Ns_Module.export$$(post)`).
* The rollup is added.

## 0.22.0

* Add Windows paths to the Resolver.

## 0.21.1

## 0.21.0

* Restructured modules in the package.
* Documentation update.

## 0.20.1

* Changed regex for parameter extraction in the Spec Analyzer.
* Removed leading namespace separator in the Resolver.
* Added `teqfw.json` descriptor to add npm-package to DI container as a sources root in `teqfw/web`.

## 0.20.0

* Fully redesigned package with simplified composition of objects in the container. Spec Analyzer is used instead of a
  proxy object.

## 0.12.1

* Hotfix for Windows delimiters.

## 0.12.0

* Standardized comments style for improved code readability and maintenance.

## 0.11.0

* Remove `TeqFw_Di_Shared_Api_Enum_Area` enumeration.
* Fix example code (`npm run example`).

## 0.10.0

* Improve error messaging.
* Use '.' instead of '#' in depIDs (Vnd_Plugin#export => Vnd_Plugin.export). Both variants are available for now.
* Experimental proxy for deps are added (Vnd_Plugin.export@@).

## 0.9.0

* `TeqFw_Di_Shared_Api_Enum_Area` enumeration is added;

## 0.8.0

* docs for plugin's teq-descriptor (see in `main` branch);
* use object notation instead of array notation in namespace replacement statements of
  teq-descriptor (`@teqfw/di.replace` node format is changed in `./teqfw.json`);
* array is used as a container for upline dependencies in the 'SpecProxy' (object was);
