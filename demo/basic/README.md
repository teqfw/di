# The Basics

* [IoC](./ioc/README.md) - Inversion of Control principle and composition root.
* [spec](./spec/README.md) - Use destructuring assignment in dependencies specification.
* [factory](./factory/README.md) - Use factories to create objects in the application.
* [import](./import/README.md) - We can use paths to import sources as dependencies.
* [proxy](./proxy/README.md) - We can replace the path to the sources with the actual dependencies in the spec proxy.
* [container](./container/README.md) - We can use ES6 module paths as dependency keys to load dependencies within the
  objects container.
* [resolve](./resolve/README.md)
