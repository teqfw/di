# The Basics

* [IoC](./ioc/README.md) - Inversion of Control principle and composition root.
* [spec](./spec/README.md) - Use destructuring assignment in dependencies specification.
* [factory](./factory/README.md) - Use factories to create objects in the application.
* [import](./import/README.md) - Use paths to import sources as dependencies.
* [proxy](./proxy/README.md) - Replace the path to the sources with the actual dependencies in the spec proxy.
* [container](./container/README.md) - Use ES6 module paths as dependency keys to load dependencies within the objects
  container.
* [resolve](./resolve/README.md) - Use human-readable keys for dependencies and convert them to paths to ES6 modules
